# Moodify-Learning
I am learning machine learning as a part of The Moodify project of the Summer of Code hosted by the WnCC club of IITB. <br>
In the first week I got familiarised with python and completed the assignment one for virus simulation. <br>
In the second week I learnt about machine learning and completed assignments 2 and 3 related to data cleaning and linear regressionj.
